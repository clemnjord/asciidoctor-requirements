title: Document Capability
description: The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the reconfigurability behavior and capability of each reconfigurable component. 
rationale: |
    Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the platform for their applications.
    Once the radio has been procured, NASA has the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID information.
    Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible without designing a new platform.
